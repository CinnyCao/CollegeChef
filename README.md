# Team 2 CollegeChef

## Phase 3
* Setup
  - Check out repository
  - Do "npm install"
  - Do "mongod"
  - Do "npm start" or "node index.js"
* API testing
  - If linix: do "npm test"
  - If using postMan
    - If input JSON is required: under Body tab, choose option "raw" with type "JSON (application/json)" and then type input here
    - If Token is required: under Headers tab, add a row with "key"="Authorization" and "value"="Bearer {token string}"
* About Token
  - Call API "/login" to get Token
  - Sample token to use:
    - user with _id 0:
      - eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VySUQiOiIwIiwiZXhwIjoxNTUyODQ1Nzg5NjM0fQ.DjnMuU5no8k8YBRttxmYnOksHbGPRkiWMqSwV7FZDAs
    - user with _id 1:
      - eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VySUQiOiIxIiwiZXhwIjoxNTUyODQwOTg0Nzk4fQ.oxRn-qB7itdDP-W8zDpwlzfmwHlC8esVqTC1Q5xZOGk
    - Note identification of these two tokens can change since the two factory users are inserted in random order
* Factory Data and Testing Data
 Â - Some factory data (required for the application to run) will be inserted on your first time running the server. This includes:
    - 2 users: 1 normal user and 1 admin
      - userName: "admin", password: "admin"
      - userName: "user", password: "user"
    - 7 ingredients
    - 3 categories
  - Some testing data (populate the database for easier api test) will be inserted too on your first time running the server. This includes:
    - 10 recipes with random userId from the 2 factory user and random categoryId from the 3 factory categories
    - each recipe is asscociated with 1-3 random factory ingredient; saved in ingredienttorecipes collection
    - each recipe is rated by each fatory user with a random rating score; saved in rates collection
    - each recipe is randomly favorited by some factory users or none; saved in favorites collection
    - each recipe is commented 0-10 times by a random factory user; saved in comments collection


## Phase 2
**Please use a server to open our site** or else some styles will not be loaded.

**Please note that the smallest width and height our website support is 270 and 370**. We found that this size is on the border of usability. It's not worthy to adapt it to a smaller size because it would be near impossible to use. For any screen size that has width **or** height that is smaller than our limit will only receive a static image. 

Here is a list of what **UI components** are functional (checked) and what are just 'place-holders' and will be implemented later:

Note:

1. Currently all recipe cards in home page, recipe browser and user profile redirect to the same recipe view page. We will render different content for different recipes in future phases.

2. HTML files in components folder are components and are not their own HTML pages.  We load them into our pages using JS, so they are missing some tags e.g. body tags.  That said, they still satisfy the W3 validator.
