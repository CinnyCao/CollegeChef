**Please use a server to open our site** or else some style will not load.

Please note that our website will display a static image if screen resolution is smaller than 270x370 (either width is smaller than 270 **or** height is smaller than 370), we found that this size is on the border of usability. It didnt make sense to adapt to a smaller size because it would be near impossible to use.

Here is a list of what **ui components** are functional (checked) and what are just 'place-holders' and will be implemented later:
